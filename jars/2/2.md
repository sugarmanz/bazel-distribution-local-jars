These JARs demonstrate the issues building with commit `bf78b8a1f97b249ff164bd23773192e106c0f949` of my branch of vaticle/bazel-distribution. Mainly that the transitive local JAR is bundled in _both_ `lib-a.jar` and `lib-b.jar` even though `lib-b.jar` has a POM dependency on `lib-a`, which already has the local vendor JAR bundled.
